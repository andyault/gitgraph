## To run
Note that while there is hot-reloading on the server, making changes won't refresh your tab

```
git clone https://github.com/andyault/gitgraph.git
cd gitgraph
npm i
npm run watch
```

## To edit
To make changes, add or edit any files in the `graphs` directory, then visit `localhost:3001/<name-of-file>`.

For documentation on making graphs, see the `lib/gitgraph` class
